# üí∏ Move Assets between Flow and EVM

### Indroduction

Welcome to our tutorial on transferring FT  and NFT between Flow Wallet, COA (Flow EVM), and EOA (Externally Owned Accounts ). As the blockchain ecosystem continues to expand, understanding how to navigate different wallets and protocols is essential for maximizing your digital asset management. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions on how to seamlessly transfer tokens between Flow Wallet and EVM environments, ensuring you can effectively manage both your fungible and non-fungible assets.&#x20;

There are three types of accounts used for EVM on Flow.

1. **Externally Owned Accounts (EOA)**: EOAs are controlled by private individuals using cryptographic keys and can initiate transactions directly. They are the primary account type for users to interact with the blockchain, holding and sending cryptocurrency or calling smart contract functions.
2. **Contract Accounts**: These accounts hold smart contract code and are governed by this code's logic. Unlike EOAs, Contract Accounts do not initiate transactions on their own but can execute transactions in response to calls they receive from EOAs or other contracts.
3. **Cadence Owned Accounts (COA)**: This is an account type unique to Flow EVM. These accounts are managed by [Cadence resources](https://cadence-lang.org/docs/1.0/language/resources) and can be used to interact with the Flow EVM from within the Cadence environment.
