### From Device Backup

When you have already logged into an account on another mobile device and want to import the same account on your current device, you can use the device backup feature. Hereâ€™s how:

**Step 1:** On your current device, select **â€˜From Device Backupâ€™**.

This will complete the device backup process, allowing you to access your account on your current device.

### From Multi Backup

A multi-backup stores multiple partial-weight keys across your accounts on trusted providers like Google Drive and iCloud(only in IOS), or a Recovery Phrase.

Two partial-weight keys must be used together to recover access to your account. Each key individually cannot be used. This means, that to recover access to your account, Flow Wallet requires access to two of your backups.

If you previously backed up your account using the multi-backup method \[[multi-backup link](broken-reference)], you can restore your account using the following steps:

**Step 1:** On your current device, select **â€˜From Multi- Backupâ€™**.

**Step 2:** Select at least two types of backup options to restore your wallet.
