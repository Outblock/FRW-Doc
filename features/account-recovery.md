# ðŸ¦º Account Recovery

Flow Reference Wallet supports account recovery by enabling users to store backups of their account credentials / private keys on their desired cloud storage provider (Google Drive, iCloud). This way, if a user loses access to their device they can restore access to their Flow accounts and assets. This mechanic improves the safety and security of Flow Reference Wallet as a non-custodial wallet on Flow, as users have the ability to perform account recovery in the event they lose access to their device.
