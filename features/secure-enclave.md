# ðŸ”“ Secure Enclave

Flowâ€™s account abstraction supports ECDSA P-256 keys which are also supported by the secure-enclave hardware on iPhone. Flow Reference Wallet will therefore move to support this credible specialized hardware for secure key management, as it enables users to benefit from the credibility, portability, utility, and security of their mobile device as their non-custodial wallet on Flow. \

Critically, using iPhoneâ€™s secure enclave to store keys removes the need for the user to set up a seed phrase, as their keys can be stored directly inside their device. Users will therefore be able to use secondary iPhone devices to store backup keys for their accounts on Flow. A user will be able to store a primary key in their day-to-day device, and backup keys across a set of backup devices in case they lose access to their primary device.
