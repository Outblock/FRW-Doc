# ⛓ Account Linking

Accounts on Flow can be linked to create an association between them. This provides many benefits, including improved user onboarding to applications on Flow. Users can sign up for an app via traditional means (email/password, social login, OAuth, etc.), while Flow account creation and key custody are handled by the application. When users become familiar with the concepts of true ownership and asset portability on Flow, they may create their self-custody Flow account using Flow Reference Wallet. \
\
The application would provide the means to claim the original (“child”) account by linking their new (“parent”) account managed by Flow Reference Wallet and delegating access control. In this way, users can claim custody and gain control of assets stored in the application account for use across the Flow ecosystem.
