## LLMs Integration

This documentation provides a special endpoint designed for AI assistants and large language models (LLMs) to easily discover and access our documentation.

### AI-Friendly Documentation Index

We provide a text-based index of all documentation pages that AI tools can fetch to understand the structure and content of this documentation.

**Endpoint:** [`/llms-full.txt`](/llms-full.txt)

This endpoint returns a plain text file containing:
- Page titles
- Page descriptions (when available)
- Direct URLs to each documentation page

### How AI Assistants Use This

AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, and other language models can:

1. Fetch the `/llms-full.txt` endpoint
2. Parse the list of available documentation pages
3. Direct users to relevant pages based on their questions
4. Provide accurate information about Flow Wallet features

### Example Usage

When a user asks an AI assistant about Flow Wallet features, the assistant can:

```
1. Check /llms-full.txt for available documentation
2. Find relevant pages (e.g., Account Linking, WalletConnect)
3. Provide direct links to specific documentation
4. Quote accurate information from the docs
```

### For Developers

If you're building an AI-powered tool or chatbot that needs to reference Flow Wallet documentation:

```bash
# Fetch the documentation index
curl https://your-docs-domain.com/llms-full.txt

# Or locally during development
curl http://localhost:3000/llms-full.txt
```

The format is simple and easy to parse:

```
# Page Title

Description (if available)

URL: /docs/page-path

---

# Next Page Title
...
```

### Edit on GitHub

All documentation pages include an "Edit on GitHub" button at the bottom, making it easy to contribute improvements or corrections to the documentation.
