# ðŸ”— Child Accounts

### Introduction

The child account will provide a safe and secure way for the child accounts to interact with the flow network.

### Overview

The purpose of this grant doc is to fund the implementation of a parent-child account feature on the Flow network. The feature will enable users to create and manage accounts on the Flow network, with the ability to set spending limits and control access to various Flow applications. This feature will improve the user experience for families using the Flow network, providing a secure and reliable way for users to manage their application interactions. The Parent-Child Account feature on Lilico will be open-sourced once finished, which means that other developers and projects on the Flow ecosystem can use and build on top of it. This will benefit the whole Flow ecosystem by providing a standardized and tested solution for parent-child account management.

### Technical Background

Two technical documents will serve as the basis for this implementation project. The first document is the Account Model Guide, which provides detailed information on how Flow accounts are structured and how they interact with one another. The second document is the Hybrid Custody Forum post, which explores the concept of hybrid custody. An account can be owned by multiple parties and controlled through a combination of smart contracts and off-chain processes.

| Assets Display Summary | User will be able to see all digital assets under all parent and child accounts together  | 4 weeks |

\*\*The second release aims to be another 5 - 6 weeks after the first release, in August.

#### Milestone 1: Link and Display Accounts

In this milestone, our team will implement the feature that allows users to link child accounts to their parent accounts on Lilico. We will create a user interface that is intuitive and user-friendly for users to link their child accounts. Once the accounts are linked, users will be able to display their child accounts on Lilico, allowing them to switch between accounts easily. This phase will take approximately one week.

#### Milestone2: Recognition

In this milestone, our team will enable the feature on Lilico to detect account linking requests and show them with a custom UI display. This feature will provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for users who want to link their accounts to Lilico. This phase will take approximately one week.

#### Milestone 3: Display Assets

In this milestone, our team will implement the feature that displays assets (fungible tokens and NFTs) under child accounts. Users will be able to view their assets after switching to a child account on Lilico. We will ensure that the display of assets is accurate, and that users can easily differentiate between assets under the parent account and child accounts. This phase will take approximately one week.

#### Milestone 4: Transfer

In this milestone, we will enable users to transfer fungible tokens and NFTs from child accounts linked to Lilico. Users will be able to initiate transfers from the child account, and the transfer will be processed on the Flow blockchain. We will ensure that the transfer process is secure and that users can transfer their assets with ease. This phase will take approximately two weeks.

#### Milestone 5: Display All Accounts

In this milestone, our team will implement the feature that displays all parent and child accounts on a single tab. Users will be able to view all their accounts and easily switch between them. We will ensure that the display of accounts is intuitive and user-friendly. This phase will take approximately three weeks.

#### Milestone 6: Hybrid Transfer

In this milestone, our team will implement the feature that enables users to transfer tokens partially from the parent account and child account. Users will be able to specify the amount of tokens they want to transfer from each account during the transfer process. We will ensure that the hybrid transfer is secure and that users can transfer their assets with ease. This phase will take approximately two weeks.

### Conclusion

The development of the Parent-Child Account feature will add value to the Flow blockchain ecosystem by enhancing security and usability. Our team has the expertise and experience to execute this project to a high standard.&#x20;
